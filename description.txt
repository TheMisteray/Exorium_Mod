Exorium Mod is an in-development mod somewhat based upon a Dungeons & Dragons campaign. This mod is in its early stages and currently only contains pre-hardmode content.

This mod currently adds
- 1 Biome
- 1 Structure
- 2 Bosses
- 30+ Weapons (Including summoner weapons)
- 1 Town NPC
- And more

Please excuse my spritework. I am not the best at it.

NOTICE: There was an issue where a crash was caused upon generating a new world. To my knowledge it was fixed, but it was rare in the first place so there is a slight chance it slipped under the radar. In the case of this occuring just generate another world.
