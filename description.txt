Exorium Mod is an in-development mod somewhat based upon a Dungeons & Dragons campaign. This mod currently only contains pre-hardmode content.

This mod currently adds
- 1 Biome
- 1 Structure
- 2 Bosses
- 30+ Weapons
- 4 Armor Sets
- 1 Town NPC
- And a few more odds and ends

Please excuse my spritework. I am not the best at it.

If you find any bugs or issues I would love to hear some feedback.
I am Mr A#4490 on Discord
